# MegaCalc
## Almost infinite Integer Calculator
---
I created a first version of this calculator in 1993.  

At that time, I read in a magazine that someone was trying to break the World record for the biggest multiplication. The record was with 2 numbers of 22,000 digits in 24 hours.  
Experimenting at that time in C++ on Windows, I already made a String based calculator for large numbers.  
So I decided to see if I could come with a fast algorithm to beat that 22,000 digits multiplication records.

After 2 weeks where I:
- Flipped my algorithm inside-out
- Reached the 640K limit of MS-DOS

But I was able to multiply two **500,000** digits numbers in less than 24 hours of computation.

In 1995, I used a Beta of Windows 95 to push that limit and I also made a Windows MegaCalc where the multiplications were interruptible and restartable.

Since then, I have implemented MegaCalc in:
- C#
- Java
- Swift

## Swift version
### Directory: Calc1-swift
The Swift version has the following properties:
- Uses a simple Mac UI
- Shows good examples of units tests
- Uses Xcode to run Unit tests and UI tests
